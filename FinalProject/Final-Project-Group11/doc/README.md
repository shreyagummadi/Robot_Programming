# ENPM809Y_Group11: Introduction to Robot Programming 
# Final Project: OOP, Inheritance, and Dynamic Polymorphism


Project Statement
========
We are tasked to develop a project using object-oriented programming, inheritance, and dynamic polymorphism. The prject will be used to drive one of the two robots (wheeled or tracked) in a maze, to reach the goal location which is located at the center of the maze. 


The project is currently hosted on GitHub:

https://github.com/sully892/Cu_Ag_Au/Final-Project-Group11


Files
========
 
There is one file for this project:
	Final-Project-Group11.zip

The program consists of the following code files:

main.cpp
landbasedrobot.h
landbasedrobot.cpp
landbasedtracked.h
landbasedtracked.cpp
landbasedwheeled.h
landbasedwheeled.cpp
algorithm.h
algorithm.cpp
api.h
app.cpp
byte.h
direction.h
maze.h
maze.cpp


Overview
========

* There are two types of robots with different driving mechanism and characteristics: Wheeled vs Tracked.

* The Ô¨Årst robot belongs to the C++ class LandBasedWheeled, which is a derived concrete class.

* The second robot belongs to the C++ class LandBasedTracked, which is a derived concrete class.

* Both classes derive from the base class LandBasedRobot, which is an abstract base class.


User Inputs
-----

In the Micromouse Simulator input the following:

* Name: finalproject
* Directory: /Desktop/Workspace/FinalProject/Final-Project-Group11/src
* Build command: g++ API/api.cpp LandBasedRobot/landbasedrobot.cpp LandBasedTracked/landbasedtracked.cpp LandBasedWheeled/landbasedwheeled.cpp Maze/maze.cpp Algorithm/algorithm.cpp Main/main.cpp
* Run Command: ./a.out


Program Output
------

* Generate path from current position (S)(0,0) to the center of the maze (G)(7,7;7,8;8,7;8,8)
* After a path is found and generated
		-Using down, right, up, left sequence
* A robot will follow the path using the function
		-After each turn of the robot the function MoveFoward needs to be called.
* Micromouse simulator will be used to display the robot simulation on the screen.
* Program exits when
		*Robot reaches G. 
		*There is no solution from S to G.


To run the file:
------

	-Step 1: Extract and open the workspace in any IDE, then build and run the main.cpp file. 
		~The zip file might contains adjacent files, make sure to that it is stored in the workspace 
		for the code to run. Otherwise. specify the location address in the code.

		* Build command: g++ API/api.cpp LandBasedRobot/landbasedrobot.cpp LandBasedTracked/landbasedtracked.cpp LandBasedWheeled/landbasedwheeled.cpp Maze/maze.cpp Heap/heap.cpp History/history.cpp Algorithm/algorithm.cpp Main/main.cpp
		* Run Command: ./a.out

To install Micromouse simulator:
------
	- git clone https://github.com/mackorone/mms
	- cd mms/src 
	- qmake && make

To launch Mircormouse simulator:
------
	- ./bin/mms


Maze:
------

* All maze have the same dimensions 16 x 16 cells with a peremeter around it making it [0,15]x[0,15]
* The robot has not previous knowledge of any wall including the perimeter walls.
		-Walls are discovered only when robot tries to drive through a wall
* All of the maze have the same goal at the center with coordinates (7,7;7,8;8,7;8,8)

Robot:
-----

* Robot will be selected from Wheeled:Husky vs Tracked:LT2-F
* Robot will always start at position (0,0), facing north.

Micromouse Simulator:
-----

The micromouse simulator (https://github.com/mackorone/mms) is a small C ++ QT simulator that allows you to visualize path planning
algorithms.

* Generates maze, Add walls and Visualize maze
		1. see robot move
		2. walls being added in the maze
		3. show the path generated by search algorithm
			-interact using build-in methods from mms project with class API


Implementation
-----

The program has several classes: 
LandBasedRobot
LandBasedTracked
LandBasedWheeled
Algorithm
API
Maze

It has two header files. 
Direction
Byte

LandBasedRobot is an abstract base class that is inherited (publicly) by the two derived concrete classes LandBasedTracked and LandBasedWheeled. This program will act as the structure for the final project which will consist of two types of robots (wheeled and tracked) that will navigate a maze, and will be capable of picking up and releasing various objects contained in the maze.

LandBasedRobot Class (public) Methods
-----

1. LandBasedRobot(std::string, int x, int y): Base class constructor which currently takes in three parameters, std::string name, int x, and int y, and assigns them to the attributes name_, x_, and y_
2. LandBasedRobot(const LandBasedRobot &source): Base class copy constructor which takes in one parameter, const LandBasedRobot &source, and performs a deep copy operation on each of the elements/attributes contained within the LandBasedRobot object being copied
3. ~LandBasedRobot(): Base class destructor
4. GoUp(int x, int y): Pure virtual method that takes in two parameters, intx and int y, which will move the robot up in the maze
5. GoDown(int x, int y): Pure virtual method that takes in two parameters, intx and int y, which will move the robot down in the maze
6. TurnLeft(int x, int y): Pure virtual method that takes in two parameters, intx and int y, which will move the robot left in the maze
7. TurnRight(int x, int y): Pure virtual method that takes in two parameters, intx and int y, which will move the robot right in the maze
8. PickUp(std::string object): Virtual method that takes in one parameter, std::string, which will cause the robot to pick up an object in the maze
9. Release(std::string object): Virtual method that takes in one parameter, std::string, which will cause the robot to release an object in the maze
10. get_x(): Accessor which returns the protected x attribute that corresponds to the x coordinate of the robot's current position in the maze 
11. get_y(): Accessor which returns the protected y attribute that corresponds to the y coordinate of the robot's current position in the maze

LandBasedRobot Class (protected) Attributes
-----

The constructor dynamically allocates memory on the heap for all pointer attributes in the class and initializes them (currently to an empty sting (""))
2. LandBasedTracked(const LandBasedTracked &source): Derived class copy constructor which takes in one parameter, const LandBasedRobot &source, and performs a deep copy operation on each of the elements/attributes contained within the LandBasedRobot object being copied by calling the base class copy constructor and dynamically allocating memory on the heap for all pointer attributes in the class
3. ~LandBasedTracked(): Derived class destructor which also frees space allocated on the heap for the pointer attributes by calling delete on the pointers allocated by new
4. GoUp(int x, int y): Overrides the pure virtual method from the base class LandBasedRobot in order to move the robot up in the maze
5. GoDown(int x, int y): Overrides the pure virtual method from the base class LandBasedRobot in order to move the robot down in the maze

The constructor dynamically allocates memory on the heap for all pointer attributes in the class and initializes them (currently to an empty sting (""))
2. LandBasedTracked(const LandBasedTracked &source): Derived class copy constructor which takes in one parameter, const LandBasedRobot &source, and performs a deep copy operation on each of the elements/attributes contained within the LandBasedRobot object being copied by calling the base class copy constructor and dynamically allocating memory on the heap for all pointer attributes in the class
3. ~LandBasedTracked(): Derived class destructor which also frees space allocated on the heap for the pointer attributes by calling delete on the pointers allocated by new
